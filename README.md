# Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The goal of this project was to build a functioning web app and to learn some of the basics of coding while also becoming familiar with some common applications used in web develepment.
- This project was built to gain knowledge and experience on a basic level of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git(github, gitbash), and to develop and deploy a basic website to demonstrate some of the new skills I have learned.
- I created this website to display my new skills that I have learned through the bootcamp prework training.
- What did you learn? Through the bootcamp prework I have learned to use Git Bash, GitHub, VSCode, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. While my understanding is base level I have laid the groundwork for success in the coding bootcamp and my career beyond.
